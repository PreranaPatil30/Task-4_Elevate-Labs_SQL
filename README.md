# Task-4_Elevate-Labs_SQL
I worked using two datasets:  customer.csv – contained customer details like customer_id, customer_city, and customer_state.  orders.csv – a dummy table I created with order_id, customer_id, product_name, and order_amount.h. Created views for repeated queries. Practiced SQL concepts like JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
